   /* OOPs, and Features:
    -> Object-oriented programming, or OOPs, is a programming model which breaks down a problem in terms of
        classes and objects.
    -> OOPs allows the creation of several instances of a class called objects, hence facilitating code reuse.

     Feature of OOPs:
     There are 4 pillars of OOPs:
     1. Abstraction
     2. Polymorphism
     3. Inheritance
     4. Encapsulation
